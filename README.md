# Paraphrase-Generation-System-Using-T5-hugging-Face-Model

## 1. Project Overview

This project uses the T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) model to generate paraphrases of input sentences. The system converts input text into token IDs, processes them through a pretrained/fine-tuned T5 model, and then converts the output numbers back into human-readable text.
